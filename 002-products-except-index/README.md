# Notes

- Brute force solution was clearest solution. Hard to read. Could probably refactor to use `reduce`.
- Hard time figuring out test cases
- Required a hint from IC to realize that we could store products going left to right then right to left... then when given a target index we just multiple the saved products in both arrays
- Wasn't able to solve without hand writing out a solved case and identifying the patterns (note below)
