# Notes

- O(n) solution was the first solution that came to mind
- Whiteboard code had a bug where i was initializing `first`, `second`, `third` with `1`.
- Even worse, when i mentally walked through the code with the bug i was convinced the output would be correct. Had to code and write tests + run to surface issue.
